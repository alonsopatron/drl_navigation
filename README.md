# Navigation example using a Deep Q-network

This repository contains a solution to the Navigation project
from the Deep Reinforcement Learning Udacity course.

## Project description

The project involves the implementation and training of an agent to "solve" a Unity ML environment.
The environment consists of a square world with yellow and blue bananas. The agent must learn to collect as many yellow bananas as possible.
The agent gets a reward of +1 for each yellow banana collected and -1 for a blue one.

The environment is considered solved if the agent gets an average score of +13 or more over 100 consecutive episodes.
